# AutoFixture.xUnit3

Custom implementation of AutoFixture.xUnit3
while waiting for [the pull request](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/pull/1471)
to get merged & v5 to come out.  
Once that happens, this will be deleted.  
**THIS IS TEMPORARY.**

## Basis
Based on [release 5 branch of AutoFixture.xUnit2 at the time of writing](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/tree/2230705d6fe3f649331e18e509bdbc9552382a81/Src/AutoFixture.xUnit2)
plus an upcoming (at time of writing) [refactor pull request](https://github.com/AutoFixture/AutoFixture/pull/1479),
as well as [xUnit's article on migrating from xUnit v2 to v3](https://xunit.net/docs/getting-started/v3/migration).  
**NOT** based on the before-mentioned pull request.
