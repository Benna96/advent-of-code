# Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent calendar that has
a two-part coding challenge for reach day from December 1st through 25th.  
This repo ~~contains~~ will contain my solutions to it, using C#.

There are no solutions yet; I found some templates for Advent of Code projects,
but wanted to make my own, so that comes first.  
I did solve the challenges of days 1-4, but they're not in this repo yet.

## Credits
- [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/) for making [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in the first place
